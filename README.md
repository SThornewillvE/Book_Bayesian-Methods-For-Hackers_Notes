## Description

I am trying to learn more about probabilistic programming and bayesian inference. Towards that end, I am reading the book "Bayesian Methods for Hackers".

While reading this book I will be taking notes and trying out writing my own code that I will upload here as a progress through the book. I did not want to create a fork of the original repo but note that some packages here are not my own but are forked from the original "Bayesian Methods for Hackers" repo from Cameron Davidson-Pilon.

## Notes

* Chapter 4 wasn't very interesting since it only has to do with explaining LoLN and its pitfalls, no code associated with it
